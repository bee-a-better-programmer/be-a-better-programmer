Obs: o material aqui vai ser escrito todo em inglês, porque desenvolver a capacidade de ler um inglês técnico é bastante necessária pra programação. No geral, os fóruns e materiais estão quase todos disponíveis em inglês.
Se você não domina um inglês técnico, não tenha medo: use o Google Translator pra traduzir o que você não entender, você vai ver que a complexidade do texto não é grande. E é uma boa chance de se acostumar com um inglês técnico.


# Be a better programmer

This repo is aimed from anyone that has had any experience with programming to junior programmer, both wanting to develop their programming skills and become better programmers. It will have some exercises to develop specially confidence, but will have exercises to develop code strutucture too. It will also compile references to sources that can be used to gain more experience on tests, essencial tools, etc.

I think developing confidence it's of the most importance. I believe it should also be trained in early steps but usually is only developed through experience and time: the **confidence** that you are able to deal with and fix code on different technologies, languages and systems, not necessarily only the ones you completely master. 

This skill is of great importance because in the life of a programmer - if you want to have a position in a company that is not stuck foverer with the same technology, same mentality and where you'll have the same level of personal development forever - is not uncommon that you'll have to fix things or add new features to a different project in order to acomplish the task you need to do. Or even if you're not going to be a programmer per say, you are only going to use programming as a tool: knowing that you can fix a problem that happens instead of being afraid of it is really important.

Usually this skill is not trained, so I have decided to try to develop material that can be used for this purpose.

# Skills

## Confidence

For the first part, on the first exercices, instead of installing the languages we need, we are going to use [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) to write and test code. I suggest logging with Github for creating one account so you can use it for your own projects.

The exercises are here [in this dashboard](https://repl.it/@debora_duarte). They are written in a lot of different languagues. In all of them, the goal is to run, check the error messages, Google them and fix the code.
Don't be afraid: they start very simple and go building up in complexity. For this reason, I suggest following the number sequence order when studying them.

# Code Structure

Besides the confidence exercises, there will be exercises on code structure that can be developed in parallel. I will create exercises that start simple and go building in complexity. The idea behind this ones is to improve code quality and structure.

## Starting

For the first exercises, just:
* go to [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) on your account;
* write the code for the exercise; 
* open this project on your browser; 
* click to create a new file and copy your code to this new file;
* click on the option *Create a **new branch** for this commit and start a pull request* that will appear bellow;
* click on the *Propose file change* option bellow;
* on the next screen that will open, click on *Create a pull request*

This process will create a *Pull request*. This is something very used in big companies so that programmers can review each other's code. The idea here is creating this review demand so I can receive it, take a look at your code and review it giving tips on better code structure.

## Next steps

Next steps in this process, once you have done a lot of confindence and code structure exercises and you're feeling confortable with the steps above - don't try this here while you're not - would be to configure your *ssh key* on Github and do it all via git command line.
Git and Github are, respectvily, a tool and a service very used by good companies to store and version control code. 
Install git on your system and configure the ssh keys on Github so you can use the command line. You can search both of these things on Google.
