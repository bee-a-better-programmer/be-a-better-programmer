# Be a better programmer

This repo is intended to collect links and references to materials that can be used to grow in skill being a programmer.
It will also have some exercises for some of the topics that are mentioned here.

It covers a topic that I think it's of the most importance, that I believe should also be trained in early steps but usually is only developed through experience and time: the **confidence** that you are able to deal and fix code on different technologies, languages and systems, not necessarily only the ones you completely master. This skill is of great importance because in a life of a programmer - if you want to have a position in a company that is not stuck foverer with the sames technology, same mentality and where you'll have the same level of personal development forever - is not uncommon that you'll have to fix things or add new features to a different project in order to acomplish the task you need to do.
